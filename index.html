        <h1>Who is Gordon Moore?</h1>
        <p>
          Gordon Moore is an American businessman, engineer,
           and the co-founder and chairman of Intel 
           corporation. Gordon Moore is most known for Intel,
           Moore's Law, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.
           Moore studied chemestry at the University of California, 
           Berkley. Moore Was excited about the potential of the transistor.

        </p>
        <h2>What's the story behind Moore's law?</h2>
        <p>
            Moore’s Law is the prediction that the number of transistors in
            a dense integrated circuit doubles every two years as technological
            progress advances. The observation was made by Gordon Moore,
            co-founder of Intel, who saw that the size of transistors was
            shrinking rapidly due to continuous innovation. Gordon Moore
            did not call his observation "Moore's Law," nor did he set
            out to create a "law." Moore made that statement based on
            noticing emerging trends in chip manufacturing at Intel.
            Eventually, Moore's insight became a prediction, which in turn
            became the golden rule known as Moore's Law.
        </p>
        <h3> What does Moore's Law say? </h3>
        <p>
            Moore’s Law has had a direct impact on the progress 
            of computing power. What this means specifically, is 
            that transistors in integrated circuits have become faster.
            Transistors conduct electricity, which contain carbon and 
            silicon molecules that can make the electricity run faster 
            across the circuit. The faster the integrated circuit 
            conducts electricity, the faster the computer operates.
        </p>
        <h4> The ramification of Moore's law
            and how industry responed to it
            and a timeline to current date.
        </h4>
        <p>
            Experts agree that computers should reach the physical limits
            of Moore's Law at some point in the 2020s. The high temperatures
            of transistors eventually would make it impossible to create 
            smaller circuits. This is because cooling down the transistors 
            takes more energy than the amount of energy that already passes 
            through the transistors. In a 2007 interview, Moore himself 
            admitted that "...the fact that materials are made of atoms is 
            the fundamental limitation and it's not that far away...We're 
            pushing up against some fairly fundamental limits so one of 
            these days we're going to have to stop making things smaller."

        <h5> Do people still talk about Moore’s Law almost 60 years later?</h5>
        <p>
            As transistors in integrated circuits become more efficient,
            computers become smaller and faster. Chips and transistors
            are microscopic structures that contain carbon and silicon
            molecules, which are aligned perfectly to move electricity
            along the circuit faster. The faster a microchip processes 
            electrical signals, the more efficient a computer becomes. 
            The cost of higher-powered computers has been dropping annually,
            partly because of lower labor costs and reduced semiconductor prices
